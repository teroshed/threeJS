feat: Add cube outlines and redesign control panel layout

üé® Major UI/UX improvements and visual enhancements

## New Features

### Cube Outlines
- Added black outlines to all cubes using EdgesGeometry + LineSegments
- Outlines automatically follow cube rotations (attached to parent mesh)
- Applied to all effects: ClickSnake, RandomCubes, SimulatedDrag
- Configurable opacity (60%) for subtle but visible edges

### Simulated Drag Effect
- New idle effect that automatically draws patterns of cubes
- 6 different patterns: circle, line, spiral, figure8, lissajous, random
- Frame throttling to prevent cube spam (spawns every 3 frames)
- Full UI controls for pattern, speed, trail length, cube size, etc.
- Uses raycasting for accurate 3D positioning

### Control Panel Redesign
- Split panel into two distinct sections: Drag Effects and Idle Effects
- Each section has its own header and cog button for quick settings access
- Cog buttons open modal directly to relevant category (no grid navigation)
- Component-based architecture with reusable effect-toggle template
- Enhanced visual feedback (green glow for active effects)
- Clean section dividers and improved spacing

## Technical Changes

### Effects System
- Modified `Effect.js` base class to add outlines to all cubes in `createCube()`
- Created `effects/idleEffects/SimulatedDrag.js` with pattern-based cursor movement
- Updated `EffectsDefaults.js` with SimulatedDrag configuration
- Registered SimulatedDrag in EffectsManager's IDLE_EFFECTS array

### UI Architecture
- Created `ui/components/panel/` folder for panel components
- Added `effect-toggle.html` template for reusable effect toggles
- Restructured `index.html` with semantic panel-body/panel-footer sections
- Enhanced `panel-simple.css` with two-section vertical layout
- Updated `settings-manager.js` to handle category-specific cog buttons

### Event Handling
- Added event handlers for SimulatedDrag controls in `ui/event-handlers.js`
- Cog buttons now use `data-category` attribute for direct navigation
- Updated modal system to support direct category opening

## Documentation
- Created `ui/components/panel/README.md` - Panel component docs
- Created `docs/PANEL_STRUCTURE.md` - Architecture guide with diagrams
- Added visual structure diagrams and interaction flows

## File Changes

### New Files
- `effects/idleEffects/SimulatedDrag.js` - Simulated drag effect class
- `ui/components/panel/effect-toggle.html` - Reusable toggle template
- `ui/components/panel/README.md` - Component documentation
- `docs/PANEL_STRUCTURE.md` - Panel architecture guide

### Modified Files
- `effects/Effect.js` - Added outline creation in createCube()
- `effects/EffectsDefaults.js` - Added SIMULATED_DRAG configuration
- `effects/EffectsManager.js` - Registered SimulatedDrag effect
- `index.html` - Restructured control panel with two sections
- `public/styles/panel-simple.css` - Enhanced two-section layout styling
- `ui/components/settings/settings-manager.js` - Direct category navigation
- `ui/event-handlers.js` - Added SimulatedDrag controls
- `ui/components/settings/effects/idle/templates/idle-effects.html` - Added SimulatedDrag UI

## Visual Improvements
- ‚ú® Cubes now have crisp black edges that make them pop
- üé® Control panel has clear visual hierarchy with section separation
- üñ±Ô∏è Improved hover states and transitions throughout UI
- üîÑ Active effects glow green (#00ff64) with bold text
- ‚öôÔ∏è Cog buttons rotate 90¬∞ on hover for better feedback
