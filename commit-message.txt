feat: Complete interactive 3D effects system with smart UI controls

✨ Features:
- Click Snake effect with 6 Z-position modes (wave, spiral, pulse, etc.)
- Smart sliders that auto-calculate ranges from config defaults
- Visual gradient background system (10 presets + direction + opacity)
- Professional glassmorphism UI with real-time controls
- Extensible effects architecture with inheritance hierarchy

🏗️ Architecture:
- Clean separation: effects/ (logic) + ui/ (controls)
- Single source of truth for all configuration
- Data-driven effect system (easy to extend)
- Magic slider system (change default → slider adapts automatically)

🔧 Technical:
- Raycasting for accurate 3D positioning
- Z-boundary clamping with configurable min/max
- Real-time parameter adjustment
- Canvas-based gradient generation
- Effects Manager with lifecycle management

🐛 Fixes:
- Fixed gradient opacity (now properly dims instead of affecting smoothness)
- Fixed magic sliders not recalculating on config change
- Fixed Z-position clamping boundaries

📁 Structure:
- effects/EffectsDefaults.js - Effect configuration
- ui/ui-options.js - UI defaults and presets
- ui/ui-controller.js - UI ↔ Effects bridge
- Comprehensive docs (README, CONFIGURATION, STRUCTURE_GUIDE)
